## The Algorithm
BFS (Breadth First Search)
Graph traversal algorithm that starts from the root node and explores all of its neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next level of depth. Check all nodes from the same level before moving on to the next level. Using queue data structure. 
- Start from root node.
- Dequeue a node from the queue.
- Visit the dequeued node and enqueue all of its neighbors.
- Repeat until queue is empty or final destination node is found.

## Tools and Libraries
- React

## Requirements
- Have npm installed with `npm install`

## Setting Up
- Clone this repository on your terminal `https://github.com/pandaandsushi/Tucil3_13522012.git`
- Go to the `frontend` directory by using `cd src/frontend`
- Type in `npm install` to start the server on your local browser
- Type in `npm start` to start the server on your local browser\
- You are done :>

## How to Use
- Input the start node and end node with words as the Wikipedia title page
- Choose between using BFS or IDS algorithm
- Please be patient and the result will be displayed below as a graph
